# Practice Python Projects

This repository contains all the projects that I completed to practice Python. All of the projects are inspired by courses and tutorials but the code is 100% my implementation of the project. When seeking projects to practice my skills I came across numerous tutorials that I used to compare my code to after I completed the project to see where I can improve and do things better.

I hope this repository can inspire your own solutions that you can then compare to mine.
